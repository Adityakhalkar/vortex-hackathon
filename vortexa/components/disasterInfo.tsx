    description: 'An earthquake is a sudden shaking of the ground caused by movements deep within the Earth. It happens when the Earth\'s plates, which are like huge puzzle pieces, shift and move against each other. This energy causes the ground to shake, sometimes gently and other times violently.',
    safety: [
      'Drop, Cover, and Hold On: Get under sturdy furniture',
      'Stay Indoors: If you\'re inside, stay there. Move away from windows, outside walls, and anything that could fall, like shelves or light fixtures.',
      'Move to Open Space if Outside: If you\'re outdoors, move to a clear area away from buildings, trees, streetlights, and power lines.',
      'Stay Away from Elevators: Always use stairs if you need to evacuate a building after the shaking stopsâ€”elevators can become dangerous.',
      'Be Prepared for Aftershocks: After the main quake, smaller aftershocks may follow. Be ready to drop, cover, and hold on again if necessary.'

      'Evacuate if Instructed: Follow evacuation orders from local authorities immediately. Move to higher ground or inland.',
      'Secure Your Home: Board up windows and doors if you cannot evacuate, stay indoors and move to a windowless interior room. Protect yourself from flying debris by seeking shelter under a sturdy furniture or closet.',
      'Turn Off Utilities: If there\'s time, switch off gas, electricity, and water to prevent accidents caused by damaged infrastructure.',
      'Avoid Low-Lying Areas: Move away from coastal areas or riverbanks, as storm surges can cause flooding.',

    safety: [
      'Move to Higher Ground: As soon as you become aware of a potential flood, move to higher ground immediately, especially if you\'re in a low-lying area.',
      'Avoid Walking or Driving in Flood Waters: It takes just six inches of moving water to knock you down, and one foot of water can sweep many cars away.',
      'Prepare an Emergency Kit: Keep supplies at the ready, including food, water, first aid supplies, and important documents.',
      'Follow Evacuation Orders: If authorities advise evacuation, do so immediately. Don\'t wait until it\'s too late.',

    safety: [
      'Move to Higher Ground: If you live in a landslide-prone area, relocate to higher ground immediately if there are warning signs such as unusual cracks, bulging ground, or tilting trees.',
      'Stay Alert During Heavy Rain: Monitor weather reports, especially during heavy rainfall, which can increase the risk of landslides. Be ready to evacuate if necessary.',
      'Listen for Unusual Sounds: Listen for unusual sounds like rumbling or cracking, which may indicate an imminent landslide. If you hear these, evacuate immediately.',
      'Avoid River Valleys: Landslides can block rivers and cause sudden flooding. Stay away from riverbeds and low-lying areas if a landslide is likely.',
